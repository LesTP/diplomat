# Diplomat — Development Log

<!-- Chronological record of what happened during development.
     Each step gets a structured entry. This is the audit trail.

     Archival rule: When this file exceeds ~500 lines, move completed
     module entries to DEVLOG_archive.md during phase completion cleanup.
     Add a boundary marker: <!-- Entries above archived from Module N, YYYY-MM-DD -->

## Module 1: Event Store + State Manager

### 2026-05-25 — Phase 1 Complete

**Action:** Phase Complete for Event Store + State Manager
**Outcome:** Complete — human audit gate set in DEVPLAN frontmatter

Completed shared storage types, SQLiteEventStore, SQLiteStateManager, state patch schema validation, audit logging, and focused tests for both modules. Detailed Phase 1 development entries were archived to `DEVLOG_archive.md`.

Verification:
- `python3 -m pytest tests/test_event_store.py tests/test_state_manager.py` — 9 passed

No new gotchas were promoted. No contract changes require propagation beyond the Phase 1 storage interfaces already captured in the ARCH files.

## Module 2: Extraction

### 2026-05-25 — Phase 2 Plan

**Action:** Phase Plan for Extraction
**Outcome:** Planned — DEVPLAN moved to `state: execute`

Defined a Build-regime plan for the Extraction module. Scope covers the public extraction API, local JSON/schema enforcement for plain-text LLM responses, deterministic rule-based fallback behavior, prompt configuration, and focused fake-provider tests.

Scope decision:
- Extraction remains stateless; batching/debounce behavior stays with Orchestrator.

### Step 2.1: Extraction API and Patch Validation Helpers

**Mode:** Build
**Outcome:** Complete — extraction result type, prompt/schema loading, JSON parsing, and state patch validation helpers added with focused tests.
**Contract changes:** None

Added the public `ExtractionResult` type and reusable helper functions for loading prompts, loading JSON schemas, parsing plain-text LLM responses as JSON objects, and validating decoded patch data against the state patch schema before wrapping it in `StatePatch`.

Verification:
- `python3 -m pytest tests/test_extraction.py` — 6 passed

### Step 2.2: Rule-Based Extraction Fallback

**Mode:** Build
**Outcome:** Complete — deterministic fallback extraction added for simple promises, coalitions, inconsistencies, and no-match empty patches.
**Contract changes:** `config/schemas/state_patch.json` now permits an empty root object so fallback extraction can return a valid no-op patch.

Implemented `RuleBasedExtractor` as a stateless async fallback with deterministic IDs and schema validation for every returned patch. The root schema now accepts `{}` while preserving validation for entity objects when they are present.

Verification:
- `python3 -m pytest tests/test_extraction.py tests/test_state_manager.py` — 16 passed

### Step 2.3: OpenAI Structured Extractor

**Mode:** Build
**Outcome:** Complete — LLM-backed extractor added with injected toolkit-compatible client, prompt assembly, COMMODITY tier usage, JSON parsing, schema validation, and failure reporting.
**Contract changes:** None

Implemented `OpenAIStructuredExtractor` without direct provider SDK imports. The extractor builds system/user messages from the configured prompt, schema, current state, trigger type, and input text, marks `intel_correction` inputs as high-confidence operator intel, and returns failed `ExtractionResult` values for LLM exceptions, invalid JSON, invalid schema, and non-text responses.

Verification:
- `python3 -m pytest tests/test_extraction.py tests/test_state_manager.py` — 21 passed
