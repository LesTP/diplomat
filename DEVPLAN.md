# Diplomat — Development Plan

## Cold Start Summary

- **What this is** — AI faction agent for a multiplayer diplomacy game, with human coaching via Telegram review gate.
- **Key constraints** — Raspberry Pi deployment, all LLM calls via toolkit/llm_client, all Telegram I/O via toolkit/telegram_client, cost governance via toolkit/cost_accountant, SQLite persistence.
- **Gotchas** —
  - Bot vs. user account question must be resolved with game moderator before deployment; implement `TelethonUserTransport` only if bot-to-bot messaging is unavailable
  - Round structure (signal vs. time-based) must be confirmed before Orchestrator event loop
  - `toolkit` lives at `../toolkit` and must be installed editable into the diplomat venv (`<venv>/bin/python3 -m pip install -e ../toolkit`). It is not declared in `pyproject.toml` to avoid a misleading install contract — fresh `pip install -e .` cannot resolve `toolkit` from PyPI, so the editable install is a one-time per-host setup step. Module-level tests use dependency-injected fakes for isolation; that pattern is fine and should continue, but integration paths in Orchestrator must exercise real `toolkit` imports

## Current Status

- **Phase** — Phase 8: Generation, implementation complete and ready for review.
- **Focus** — Review Phase 8 against `ARCH_generation.md`.
- **Blocked/Broken** — None.

## Phase 8: Generation

Regime: Build. Scope: `GenerationResult` dataclass, `LLMGenerator.generate()`, review-gate JSON response parsing, plain-text mode, generation prompt/config artifacts, and full regression coverage. No direct provider SDK imports; all LLM calls stay behind toolkit-compatible dependency injection.

Steps:
- [x] 8.1 — Implement `GenerationResult` and `LLMGenerator` in `src/modules/generation/__init__.py`. Constructor accepts toolkit-compatible LLM config/client dependency, tier, max_tokens, and `review_gate_enabled`; `generate(context)` calls the injected completion client with `DecisionContext.system_prompt` and `DecisionContext.user_prompt`, returns `success=False` for client exceptions, and preserves provider/debug response data where available. Add `tests/test_generation.py` coverage for successful plain-text generation, client exception failure, prompt forwarding, tier/max token forwarding, and provider/raw response propagation. Run focused tests.
- [x] 8.2 — Add review-gate JSON handling and generation prompt/config artifacts. When `review_gate_enabled=True`, require JSON containing `response` and `reasoning`; reject malformed JSON, missing/blank response, and schema-shaped failures through `GenerationResult.success=False`. When disabled, treat nonblank plain text as `response_text` with `reasoning=None`. Create `config/prompts/generation.txt` with JSON/plain output instructions aligned to `ARCH_generation.md`. Run focused tests plus full regression.
- [x] 8.3 — Documentation cleanup and regression verification. Verify the full suite, update Phase 8 summary/status, mark implementation sequence row 9 as pending review, and transition DEVPLAN to `state: review`.

Summary: Implemented `GenerationResult`, `LLMGenerator`, review-gate JSON parsing (`response`, `reasoning`), plain-text mode, raw response preservation, `config/prompts/generation.txt`, and 11 focused Generation tests. Full regression: 98 passed. Pending review should check the Context Assembler review-gate instruction wording against Generation's expected JSON keys.

## Phase 7: Context Assembler

Complete. Implemented `CoachingEntry`, `DecisionContext`, `DefaultContextAssembler` (pure composition, no external deps), 7-test coverage with 87 total regression tests passing. Phase Review passed with no must-fix or should-fix items. See `DEVLOG.md`.

## Phase 6: Analyst + Divergence

Complete. Implemented shared intelligence result types, `LLMAnalyst`, pure divergence comparison, analyst prompt/schema, and 12-test coverage with 80 total regression tests passing. See `DEVLOG.md`.

## Phase 5: Persona

Regime: Build. Scope: `CoachingContext` dataclass, `FileBasedPersona` (both public methods), hot-reload, `config/faction_prompt.txt` sample, full test coverage.

Steps:
- [x] 5.1 — Implement `CoachingContext` + `FileBasedPersona` (`get_base_prompt`, `build_round_context`) in `src/modules/persona/__init__.py`. Write `tests/test_persona.py` covering: FileNotFoundError, fresh read, hot-reload on mtime change, no-reload when unchanged, CURRENT ROUND CONTEXT section stripping, `build_round_context` formatting with all fields, empty fields, `rounds_remaining=None`. Run full suite.
- [x] 5.2 — Create `config/faction_prompt.txt` with sample faction persona including `## CURRENT ROUND CONTEXT` marker. Run full regression (59 + new persona tests pass). Update DEVPLAN summary, DEVLOG, ARCHITECTURE.md status.

## Phase 1: Event Store + State Manager

Complete. Implemented shared storage types, SQLiteEventStore, SQLiteStateManager, state patch schema validation, audit logging, and Phase 1 test coverage. See `DEVLOG_archive.md` and the 2026-05-25 phase completion entry in `DEVLOG.md`.

## Phase 2: Extraction

Complete. Implemented `ExtractionResult`, `OpenAIStructuredExtractor`, `RuleBasedExtractor`, local JSON/schema enforcement, rule-based promise/coalition/inconsistency fallback, `config/prompts/state_updater.txt`, and 18-test coverage with fake toolkit client. 27 tests pass (including Phase 1 regression). See `DEVLOG_archive.md` and the 2026-05-25 phase completion entry in `DEVLOG.md`.

## Phase 3: Coaching

Complete. Implemented `config/coaching_routes.yaml`, `CoachingEvent`, `Command`, `RouteRule`, `TaggedCoachingParser`, config validation, tagged/free coaching parsing, slash command parsing, and 11-test coverage with 38 total regression tests passing. See `DEVLOG_archive.md` and the 2026-05-25 phase completion entry in `DEVLOG.md`.

## Phase 4: Transport

Complete. Implemented shared Transport API exports, `CLITransport`, dependency-injected `TelegramBotTransport` send/listen paths, and 21 focused Transport tests with 59 total regression tests passing. See `DEVLOG_archive.md` and the 2026-05-25 phase completion entry in `DEVLOG.md`.
