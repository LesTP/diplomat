# Diplomat — Development Plan

<!-- This file is the primary state document for cold-start sessions.
     Workers read it on every cold start to determine what to do next.
     Keep it concise — the DEVPLAN should get SHORTER as work progresses.

     For autonomous projects, the frontmatter includes a `state` field:
       state: plan | execute | review | close
     See WORKER_SPEC.md for state-machine semantics.

     `steps_remaining` is managed by the state machine at runtime — do NOT
     pre-populate. -->

## Cold Start Summary

<!-- Stable section — update on major shifts, not every step.

     DEVLOG_archive.md, not here. -->

- **What this is** — AI faction agent for a multiplayer diplomacy game, with human coaching via Telegram review gate.
- **Key constraints** — Raspberry Pi deployment, all LLM calls via toolkit/llm_client, all Telegram I/O via toolkit/telegram_client, cost governance via toolkit/cost_accountant, SQLite persistence.
- **Gotchas** —
  - `toolkit` lives at `../toolkit` and must be installed editable per host (`<venv>/bin/python3 -m pip install -e ../toolkit`). Not declared in `pyproject.toml` (would be a misleading install contract — can't resolve from PyPI). Module-level tests use dependency-injected fakes; integration paths must exercise real `toolkit` imports.
  - Toolkit Phase 19 surface must import on the Pi: `from toolkit.llm_client import complete_with_retry` and `from toolkit.cost_accountant import normalize_model_name`. If ImportError, reinstall editable. See `SMOKE_RUNBOOK.md` §1.
  - **Pi deployment mechanism:** `incus exec claude-code -- bash /home/claude/workspace/diplomat/tools/service.sh start` is the canonical bot start command. `tools/service.sh` uses a `diplomat` window in the long-lived `bot` tmux session under the hood; override the session with `BOT_TMUX_SESSION` for tests or parallel deployments. See `CLI_REFERENCE.md` and `diplomat-testing-doc.md` §5b.
  - Bot vs. user account: must be resolved with game moderator before deployment. Implement `TelethonUserTransport` only if bot-to-bot is blocked.
  - Round structure (signal vs. time-based): confirm with moderator before deploying; set in `pipeline.yaml`.
  - **Telegram bot-to-bot platform limitation:** Telegram does NOT deliver bot-sent messages to other bots in groups, regardless of privacy mode. Non-operator faction-traffic in any Telegram-side test requires either a 2nd human Telegram account on another device, or a temporary de-op cycle (remove operator's user ID from `DIPLOMAT_OPERATOR_USER_IDS`).
  - **Debounce strategy:** per-event task set (each game message gets its own extraction task; no cancellation between different messages). The original cancel-and-replace design silently dropped messages in multi-message bursts.
  - **Cost governance:** CostAccountant wired through `ToolkitLLMAdapter` — every LLM call routes through `accountant.complete()` for budget-check + ledger write. `DiplomatCostGate` provides the check-before-call pattern for round-level budget control. Both share the same accountant instance.
  - All four LLM modules (extraction, analyst, adversarial, generation) use `toolkit.structured_llm.structured_call()` for schema-enforced JSON with retry-on-validation-failure.
  - Self-play cost ledger uses a local temp path (`%TEMP%/diplomat_selfplay/`) to avoid UNC path issues on network shares.
  - **Cross-provider JSON formatting:** Anthropic and Google wrap JSON in ` ```json ... ``` ` Markdown fences regardless of explicit "raw JSON" instructions. OpenAI returns raw. Toolkit's `parse_json_response` strips a single surrounding code fence; without this, structured_call's retries silently exhaust.
  - **Self-play env loading:** `tests/self_play/run_simulation.py` calls `load_dotenv()` at module top. Subprocess SDKs (Anthropic, Google) need this — only `OPENAI_API_KEY` was reliable from parent shell otherwise.
  - **Probe before live multi-provider runs:** `python -m tests.self_play.probe_providers --providers '<same JSON as --per-faction-providers>'` hits each provider once with a trivial request (~$0.001 total). Catches API keys, fence wrapping, model-name typos that `DryRunLLMClient` can't catch (DryRun replaces the LLM client entirely with canned responses).
  - For **Gemini 2.5 flash / pro**, set `--max-tokens 500` or higher on probes — thinking-mode consumes output tokens before producing visible content. `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` has no thinking mode and is the tuning default.
  - **Per-faction provider routing:** `--per-faction-providers '{"alpha":{"provider":"openai","model":"gpt-4.1-mini"},...}'` varies only the Generator per faction; other modules stay on shared primary/secondary. Verify with `verify_dryrun --expect-providers '{"alpha":"openai",...}'`.
  - **Pre-compiled analysis loader:** `--analysis-json <path>` skips live LLM compilation and loads a pre-edited analysis JSON (preserves hand-tuned BATNAs, scoring, deception tactics). Requires `--scenario` for the seed-message text.
  - **Prompt regression runner:** `_judge_response_text()` JSON path extraction must be wrapped in try-catch — if a scenario's `path` doesn't exist in module output, raw KeyError crashes the runner.
  - **Production reconciler is wired** in `src/main.py` via `_attach_reconciler` using primary provider's commodity tier; fires at every round boundary before analysts. Self-play harness has its own per-faction wiring that overrides.
  - **`game.total_rounds` optional config** in `pipeline.yaml` — when set, `Orchestrator.__init__` reads it and the persona's PENULTIMATE / FINAL ROUND markers fire. Unset = production stays endgame-blind (correct default when round count is unknown).
  - **Follow `RUN_PROTOCOL.md` for any live multi-agent run** (define inputs → verify scenario → probe providers → dry-run plumbing → run live → verify output → document). Skip rules and abort conditions are spelled out.
  - **Canonical docs at project root:** `ASSESSMENT.md` (skill framework + 4 scoring lenses + 3 workstream blocks A/B/C; tagged in NEXT_STEPS), `CLI_REFERENCE.md` (every CLI entry point), `SMOKE_RUNBOOK.md` (Telegram coaching/review smoke procedure), `RUN_PROTOCOL.md` (self-play pre-flight), `TUNING.md` (BATNA + provider defaults + prompt-tuning practice), `TUNING_LOG.md` (run-by-run record), `NEXT_STEPS.md` (forward backlog + 🔨/🔀/👁 loop-readiness classification).
  - **Reference docs to keep in sync** — see CLAUDE.md / CODEX.md "Reference Docs to Keep in Sync" section. Each Build phase's step list includes an explicit "doc update" step before phase-review naming the affected docs.

## Current Status

- **Phase** — Phase 29 active (vs-Naive baseline scorers). Phase 28 closed.
- **Focus** — Add three baseline scorers (equal-split, BATNA-clearing, Nash bargaining) to the scoring pipeline. Pure build, no LLM cost.
- **Blocked/Broken** — None.

<!-- Phase ordering convention:
       - Open / queued phases first, in forward execution order (next-to-do first).
       - Then a `<!-- history -->` marker separates open from closed.
       - Below the marker: closed phases in reverse-chronological order
         (most recently closed first; same-day closes sorted by phase number descending).
     This puts the active work at the top and the "recent past" right under it,
     with deep history at the bottom. -->

## Phase 29: vs-Naive baseline scorers (equal-split, BATNA-clearing, Nash bargaining)

**Goal:** Add three baseline reference points to the scoring pipeline so every
run's results can answer "did negotiation outperform naive strategies?" per
ASSESSMENT.md §3.3. Pure build — no LLM calls, no experiments.

**Key infrastructure (read before starting):**
- `_pareto_efficiency_metrics()` in `tests/self_play/game_environment.py:684` — the
  central scoring function. Returns a dict merged into `score_game()` output.
- `enumerate_deals()` + `faction_score()` + `beats_batna()` in
  `tests/self_play/verify_scenario_optimum.py` — deal enumeration and scoring helpers.
- `_pareto_scenario()` in `tests/test_self_play.py:82` — 2-faction, 1-issue test fixture.
- `_METRIC_KEYS` in `tools/backfill_scoring_metrics.py:24` — controls which fields
  are backfilled into historical run JSONs.
- `NO-DEAL-AWARE SCORING` section in `tests/self_play/analysis.py:292` — report rendering.

### Steps

1. **Add `_compute_baselines()` to `game_environment.py`.**
   New function alongside `_pareto_efficiency_metrics()`. Same signature:
   `(scenario_analysis: dict, score_data: dict) -> dict`. Reuses
   `enumerate_deals()`, `faction_score()`, `beats_batna()` from
   `verify_scenario_optimum.py` (already importable — same package).
   Returns a dict with all baseline fields (steps 2–4 below).

2. **Equal-split baseline.**
   `equal_split_baseline = max_pareto_sum / len(factions)` — the score each
   faction would get if optimal surplus were divided equally. Per-faction:
   `vs_equal_split[faction] = achieved_score - equal_split_baseline`.
   Positive = beat fair share, negative = below.
   Output keys: `equal_split_baseline`, `vs_equal_split: {faction: float}`.

3. **BATNA-clearing baseline.**
   Per-faction max possible: `max_possible[faction] = max(faction_score(analysis, faction, d) for d in all_deals)`.
   Per-faction skill premium: `skill_premium_vs_batna[faction] = (score - batna) / (max_possible - batna)`.
   Range: 0.0 = scored at BATNA, 1.0 = scored at faction max. Can be negative.
   Output keys: `max_possible_per_faction: {faction: float}`,
   `skill_premium_vs_batna: {faction: float}`.

4. **Nash bargaining baseline.**
   Filter deals to those where `beats_batna()` is true (all factions strictly
   above BATNA). For each, compute `math.prod(scores[f] - batna[f] for f in factions)`.
   Find the deal with the maximum product — that's the Nash bargaining solution.
   Output keys: `nash_deal_scores: {faction: float}`, `nash_deal_sum: float`,
   `nash_product: float`, `vs_nash_efficiency: float` (= `achieved_sum / nash_deal_sum`).
   Edge case: if no deal beats all BATNAs, set all Nash fields to `None`.

5. **Wire into scoring pipeline.**
   In `score_game()` (or `_pareto_efficiency_metrics()`), call
   `_compute_baselines(scenario_analysis, score_data)` and merge the result
   into the returned dict, same pattern as the existing
   `score_data.update(_pareto_efficiency_metrics(...))`.

6. **Unit tests.**
   Add a `TestBaselines` class (or extend `TestParetoEfficiency`) in
   `tests/test_self_play.py`. Use the existing `_pareto_scenario()` fixture.
   Test cases:
   - Equal-split: optimal deal → `vs_equal_split` shows which faction gained/lost vs fair share.
   - Equal-split: no-deal → `vs_equal_split` all negative (scores at BATNA < equal share of optimum).
   - BATNA-clearing: optimal deal → `skill_premium_vs_batna` = 1.0 for all factions.
   - BATNA-clearing: at-BATNA deal → `skill_premium_vs_batna` = 0.0 for all factions.
   - Nash: on `_pareto_scenario()`, the Nash deal should equal the Pareto optimum (2 factions, 1 issue — product is maximized at the sum-maximizing deal).
   - Nash: no BATNA-clearing deals exist → all Nash fields are `None`.
   - 3-faction fixture where Nash deal ≠ Pareto-sum-maximizing deal (asymmetric surplus).

7. **Report rendering.**
   Add a `BASELINE COMPARISONS` subsection to the `NO-DEAL-AWARE SCORING`
   block in `tests/self_play/analysis.py`. Print:
   - `equal_split_baseline`, per-faction `vs_equal_split`
   - Per-faction `skill_premium_vs_batna`
   - `nash_deal_sum`, `nash_product`, `vs_nash_efficiency`, per-faction `nash_deal_scores`

8. **Backfill support.**
   Add the new keys to `_METRIC_KEYS` in `tools/backfill_scoring_metrics.py`.
   Verify the backfill script runs cleanly on one historical run JSON
   (e.g. `run9_beta_squeezed_live.json`).

9. **Doc updates.**
   - `ASSESSMENT.md` §3.3: mark equal-split as implemented; add BATNA-clearing
     and Nash bargaining descriptions. Update §3.5 composition table.
   - `diplomat-testing-doc.md`: update Layer 4 scoring description with new fields.
   - `NEXT_STEPS.md`: mark "ASSESSMENT §3.3 vs Naive baseline" as closed in
     Tier 2 table; move to Appendix A.

### Verification

`python -m pytest tests/test_self_play.py -v -k "baseline or nash or equal_split"` — all new tests pass.
`python tools/backfill_scoring_metrics.py --results <any-run>.json --analysis <matching-analysis>.json` — prints new fields without error.
Existing 346 tests still pass.
