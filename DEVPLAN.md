# Diplomat — Development Plan

<!-- This file is the primary state document for cold-start sessions.
     Workers read it on every cold start to determine what to do next.
     Keep it concise — the DEVPLAN should get SHORTER as work progresses.

     For autonomous projects, the frontmatter includes a `state` field:
       state: plan | execute | review | close
     See WORKER_SPEC.md for state-machine semantics.

     `steps_remaining` is managed by the state machine at runtime — do NOT
     pre-populate. -->

## Cold Start Summary

- **What this is** — AI faction agent for a multiplayer diplomacy game, with human coaching via Telegram review gate.
- **Key constraints** — Raspberry Pi deployment, all LLM calls via toolkit/llm_client, all Telegram I/O via toolkit/telegram_client, cost governance via toolkit/cost_accountant, SQLite persistence.
- **Gotchas** —
  - `toolkit` lives at `../toolkit` and must be installed editable per host (`<venv>/bin/python3 -m pip install -e ../toolkit`). Not declared in `pyproject.toml` (would be a misleading install contract — can't resolve from PyPI). Module-level tests use dependency-injected fakes; integration paths must exercise real `toolkit` imports.
  - Toolkit Phase 19 surface must import on the Pi: `from toolkit.llm_client import complete_with_retry` and `from toolkit.cost_accountant import normalize_model_name`. If ImportError, reinstall editable. See `SMOKE_RUNBOOK.md` §1.
  - **Pi deployment mechanism:** `incus exec claude-code -- bash /home/claude/workspace/diplomat/tools/service.sh start` is the canonical bot start command. `tools/service.sh` uses a `diplomat` window in the long-lived `bot` tmux session under the hood; override the session with `BOT_TMUX_SESSION` for tests or parallel deployments. See `CLI_REFERENCE.md` and `diplomat-testing-doc.md` §5b.
  - Bot vs. user account: must be resolved with game moderator before deployment. Implement `TelethonUserTransport` only if bot-to-bot is blocked.
  - Round structure (signal vs. time-based): confirm with moderator before deploying; set in `pipeline.yaml`.
  - **Telegram bot-to-bot platform limitation:** Telegram does NOT deliver bot-sent messages to other bots in groups, regardless of privacy mode. Non-operator faction-traffic in any Telegram-side test requires either a 2nd human Telegram account on another device, or a temporary de-op cycle (remove operator's user ID from `DIPLOMAT_OPERATOR_USER_IDS`).
  - **Debounce strategy:** per-event task set (each game message gets its own extraction task; no cancellation between different messages). The original cancel-and-replace design silently dropped messages in multi-message bursts.
  - **Cost governance:** CostAccountant wired through `ToolkitLLMAdapter` — every LLM call routes through `accountant.complete()` for budget-check + ledger write. `DiplomatCostGate` provides the check-before-call pattern for round-level budget control. Both share the same accountant instance.
  - All four LLM modules (extraction, analyst, adversarial, generation) use `toolkit.structured_llm.structured_call()` for schema-enforced JSON with retry-on-validation-failure.
  - Self-play cost ledger uses a local temp path (`%TEMP%/diplomat_selfplay/`) to avoid UNC path issues on network shares.
  - **Cross-provider JSON formatting:** Anthropic and Google wrap JSON in ` ```json ... ``` ` Markdown fences regardless of explicit "raw JSON" instructions. OpenAI returns raw. Toolkit's `parse_json_response` strips a single surrounding code fence; without this, structured_call's retries silently exhaust.
  - **Self-play env loading:** `tests/self_play/run_simulation.py` calls `load_dotenv()` at module top. Subprocess SDKs (Anthropic, Google) need this — only `OPENAI_API_KEY` was reliable from parent shell otherwise.
  - **Probe before live multi-provider runs:** `python -m tests.self_play.probe_providers --providers '<same JSON as --per-faction-providers>'` hits each provider once with a trivial request (~$0.001 total). Catches API keys, fence wrapping, model-name typos that `DryRunLLMClient` can't catch (DryRun replaces the LLM client entirely with canned responses).
  - For **Gemini 2.5 flash / pro**, set `--max-tokens 500` or higher on probes — thinking-mode consumes output tokens before producing visible content. `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` has no thinking mode and is the tuning default.
  - **Per-faction provider routing:** `--per-faction-providers '{"alpha":{"provider":"openai","model":"gpt-4.1-mini"},...}'` varies only the Generator per faction; other modules stay on shared primary/secondary. Verify with `verify_dryrun --expect-providers '{"alpha":"openai",...}'`.
  - **Pre-compiled analysis loader:** `--analysis-json <path>` skips live LLM compilation and loads a pre-edited analysis JSON (preserves hand-tuned BATNAs, scoring, deception tactics). Requires `--scenario` for the seed-message text.
  - **Prompt regression runner:** `_judge_response_text()` JSON path extraction must be wrapped in try-catch — if a scenario's `path` doesn't exist in module output, raw KeyError crashes the runner.
  - **Production reconciler is wired** in `src/main.py` via `_attach_reconciler` using primary provider's commodity tier; fires at every round boundary before analysts. Self-play harness has its own per-faction wiring that overrides.
  - **`game.total_rounds` optional config** in `pipeline.yaml` — when set, `Orchestrator.__init__` reads it and the persona's PENULTIMATE / FINAL ROUND markers fire. Unset = production stays endgame-blind (correct default when round count is unknown).
  - **Follow `RUN_PROTOCOL.md` for any live multi-agent run** (define inputs → verify scenario → probe providers → dry-run plumbing → run live → verify output → document). Skip rules and abort conditions are spelled out.
  - **Canonical docs at project root:** `ASSESSMENT.md` (skill framework + 4 scoring lenses + 3 workstream blocks A/B/C; tagged in NEXT_STEPS), `CLI_REFERENCE.md` (every CLI entry point), `SMOKE_RUNBOOK.md` (Telegram coaching/review smoke procedure), `RUN_PROTOCOL.md` (self-play pre-flight), `TUNING.md` (BATNA + provider defaults + prompt-tuning practice), `TUNING_LOG.md` (run-by-run record), `NEXT_STEPS.md` (forward backlog + 🔨/🔀/👁 loop-readiness classification).
  - **Reference docs to keep in sync** — see CLAUDE.md / CODEX.md "Reference Docs to Keep in Sync" section. Each Build phase's step list includes an explicit "doc update" step before phase-review naming the affected docs.

## Current Status

- **Phase** — Phase 33 closed 2026-06-07. Coaching v2: `/revise: <directive>` LLM-rewrite edit mode + auto-classifier for the review-gate edit log. See `DEVLOG.md` "Phase 33 close".
- **Focus** — Closed. Run 14 remains queued in `NEXT_STEPS.md` as the live validation step after phase close.
- **Blocked/Broken** — `blocked: true`.

## Phase 32: Toolkit-level TG chunking + Diplomat cleanup + queue-drain + /intel trim — Complete

Closed 2026-06-04. Pushed Telegram message chunking down to `toolkit/telegram_client` — `TelegramClient.send_message` auto-chunks oversized text via the upgraded paragraph-first `split_message` (with `[continued ...]` markers); `CONTINUATION_PREFIX` constant exported. Diplomat's local `chunk_text` helper removed; `OperatorReviewGate._send_draft` / `_send_section` simplified to single-send compose. `CoachedGameEnvironment._listen_for_operator` now drains pending TG updates on startup (1s window) so stale `/approve`-style commands from previously-killed sessions can't auto-resolve R1. `/intel` operator command trimmed to the latest intelligence row (compact summary: faction, round, threat level, leverage, risks) instead of dumping every row's full JSON. Decisions D-46 (toolkit-level auto-chunking) and D-47 (coached-game startup drain window). Steps 32.1 + 32.2 (operator-driven shared toolkit changes) + 32.3-32.6 (autonomous loop, Diplomat cleanup + tests + docs) + 32.7 (cross-project NEXT_STEPS notes skipped — operator clarified NEXT_STEPS.md is a Diplomat-specific convention, knowledge preserved in toolkit docs + Diplomat DEVLOG/DECISIONS). See `DEVLOG.md` "Phase 32 close" + `TUNING_LOG.md` Run 13 (the run that surfaced the queue-staleness + /intel issues).

## Phase 31: Transport-routed OperatorReviewGate — Complete

Closed 2026-06-04. Shipped `OperatorReviewGate` (transport-based, chunked, lazy `/reasoning` + `/adversarial` fetch, command pass-through via `Pipeline.dispatch_operator` → `handle_command`). Hard rename from `TelegramReviewGate`. `chunk_text` helper added to `src/modules/review_gate/chunking.py`. Decisions D-39 through D-43. 370 tests passing on Linux Pi.

**Phase 31a hotfix (same session):** `CoachedGameEnvironment` operator-input bridge — `RoundSteppedFlow` lacked the `EventDrivenFlow.process_event` routing that the new passive gate relies on, so coached games hung at the first review prompt. Added `_listen_for_operator(tg_transport, pipeline)` that consumes the wrapped `TelegramBotTransport.listen()` and forwards operator-tagged events to `dispatch_operator`. Decision D-44.

Validated end-to-end via Run 13 (first coached game with new gate, all-Gemini-flash on Water Rights symmetric). Run 13 surfaced two follow-up items now queued as Phase 32: (a) operator command responses also need chunking (`/intel` silently dropped at oversize), and (b) the listener should drain stale TG-queue updates on startup so a previously-killed session can't poison R1 of the next session. See `DEVLOG.md` "Phase 31 Close" + "Phase 31a hotfix" + `TUNING_LOG.md` Run 13 for details.


## Phase 30: OpenRouter provider connector — Complete

Use `--per-faction-providers '{"alpha":{"provider":"openrouter","model":"<model-id>"}}'` in any self-play run with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set. See DEVLOG.md "Phase 30 close" section.

## Phase 29: vs-Naive baseline scorers (equal-split, BATNA-clearing, Nash bargaining) — Complete

Closed 2026-06-03. Added equal-split, BATNA-clearing, and Nash bargaining baseline scorers to the self-play scoring pipeline, rendered them in report output, backfilled historical metrics, and closed D-33. See `DEVLOG.md` "Phase 29 close".

## Phase 25: `tools/service.sh` tmux rewrite — Complete

Closed 2026-06-01. Rewrote `tools/service.sh` to supervise the bot in a `diplomat` tmux window inside the long-lived `bot` session, with `BOT_TMUX_SESSION` override, tmux-backed `start`/`stop`/`status`/`restart`, and a shell smoke test. 331 tests passing. See `DEVLOG_archive.md` "Archived 2026-06-01 — Phase 25 service tmux rewrite" section.

## Phase 24: Small builds + Level 1 modularization — Complete
