# Diplomat — Development Plan

## Cold Start Summary

- **What this is** — AI faction agent for a multiplayer diplomacy game, with human coaching via Telegram review gate.
- **Key constraints** — Raspberry Pi deployment, all LLM calls via toolkit/llm_client, all Telegram I/O via toolkit/telegram_client, cost governance via toolkit/cost_accountant, SQLite persistence.
- **Gotchas** —
  - Bot vs. user account question must be resolved with game moderator before deployment; implement `TelethonUserTransport` only if bot-to-bot messaging is unavailable
  - Round structure (signal vs. time-based) must be confirmed before Orchestrator event loop
  - `toolkit` lives at `../toolkit` and must be installed editable into the diplomat venv (`<venv>/bin/python3 -m pip install -e ../toolkit`). It is not declared in `pyproject.toml` to avoid a misleading install contract — fresh `pip install -e .` cannot resolve `toolkit` from PyPI, so the editable install is a one-time per-host setup step. Module-level tests use dependency-injected fakes for isolation; that pattern is fine and should continue, but integration paths in Orchestrator must exercise real `toolkit` imports

## Current Status

- **Phase** — Phase 7: Context Assembler, in progress.
- **Focus** — Planning complete. Next: implement `CoachingEntry`, `DecisionContext`, `DefaultContextAssembler` with full `assemble()` method and tests.
- **Blocked/Broken** — None.

## Phase 7: Context Assembler

Regime: Build. Scope: Pure composition module — no external deps. `CoachingEntry` dataclass, `DecisionContext` dataclass, `DefaultContextAssembler` with `assemble()` method assembling all inputs into the Decision Engine context window per the ARCH_context_assembler.md template. Full test coverage.

Steps:
- [ ] 7.1 — Implement `CoachingEntry`, `DecisionContext`, and `DefaultContextAssembler` (with `recent_events_limit=30` default) in `src/modules/context_assembler/__init__.py`. Write `tests/test_context_assembler.py` covering: all five coaching types in output, INTEL exclusion from coaching section, divergences present vs. absent, review_gate enabled vs. disabled instruction text, recent_events_limit truncation applied, metadata fields (event_count, coaching_count), empty coaching queue placeholder, section order matches template. Run full suite (target: 80 + new tests pass).
- [ ] 7.2 — Run full regression. Update DEVPLAN Current Status, DEVLOG, ARCHITECTURE.md sequence status. Commit.

## Phase 6: Analyst + Divergence

Complete. Implemented shared intelligence result types, `LLMAnalyst`, pure divergence comparison, analyst prompt/schema, and 12-test coverage with 80 total regression tests passing. See `DEVLOG.md`.

## Phase 5: Persona

Regime: Build. Scope: `CoachingContext` dataclass, `FileBasedPersona` (both public methods), hot-reload, `config/faction_prompt.txt` sample, full test coverage.

Steps:
- [x] 5.1 — Implement `CoachingContext` + `FileBasedPersona` (`get_base_prompt`, `build_round_context`) in `src/modules/persona/__init__.py`. Write `tests/test_persona.py` covering: FileNotFoundError, fresh read, hot-reload on mtime change, no-reload when unchanged, CURRENT ROUND CONTEXT section stripping, `build_round_context` formatting with all fields, empty fields, `rounds_remaining=None`. Run full suite.
- [x] 5.2 — Create `config/faction_prompt.txt` with sample faction persona including `## CURRENT ROUND CONTEXT` marker. Run full regression (59 + new persona tests pass). Update DEVPLAN summary, DEVLOG, ARCHITECTURE.md status.

## Phase 1: Event Store + State Manager

Complete. Implemented shared storage types, SQLiteEventStore, SQLiteStateManager, state patch schema validation, audit logging, and Phase 1 test coverage. See `DEVLOG_archive.md` and the 2026-05-25 phase completion entry in `DEVLOG.md`.

## Phase 2: Extraction

Complete. Implemented `ExtractionResult`, `OpenAIStructuredExtractor`, `RuleBasedExtractor`, local JSON/schema enforcement, rule-based promise/coalition/inconsistency fallback, `config/prompts/state_updater.txt`, and 18-test coverage with fake toolkit client. 27 tests pass (including Phase 1 regression). See `DEVLOG_archive.md` and the 2026-05-25 phase completion entry in `DEVLOG.md`.

## Phase 3: Coaching

Complete. Implemented `config/coaching_routes.yaml`, `CoachingEvent`, `Command`, `RouteRule`, `TaggedCoachingParser`, config validation, tagged/free coaching parsing, slash command parsing, and 11-test coverage with 38 total regression tests passing. See `DEVLOG_archive.md` and the 2026-05-25 phase completion entry in `DEVLOG.md`.

## Phase 4: Transport

Complete. Implemented shared Transport API exports, `CLITransport`, dependency-injected `TelegramBotTransport` send/listen paths, and 21 focused Transport tests with 59 total regression tests passing. See `DEVLOG_archive.md` and the 2026-05-25 phase completion entry in `DEVLOG.md`.
