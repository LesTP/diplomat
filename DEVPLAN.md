# Diplomat — Development Plan

## Cold Start Summary

- **What this is** — AI faction agent for a multiplayer diplomacy game, with human coaching via Telegram review gate.
- **Key constraints** — Raspberry Pi deployment, all LLM calls via toolkit/llm_client, all Telegram I/O via toolkit/telegram_client, cost governance via toolkit/cost_accountant, SQLite persistence.
- **Gotchas** —
  - Bot vs. user account question must be resolved with game moderator before Transport implementation
  - Round structure (signal vs. time-based) must be confirmed before Orchestrator event loop

## Current Status

- **Phase** — Phase 2 complete — awaiting human audit. Next: Phase 3 (Coaching).
- **Focus** — Human audit gate set. `/close` to clear and open Phase 3.
- **Blocked/Broken** — Awaiting human audit (`blocked: true`)

## Phase 1: Event Store + State Manager

Complete. Implemented shared storage types, SQLiteEventStore, SQLiteStateManager, state patch schema validation, audit logging, and Phase 1 test coverage. See `DEVLOG_archive.md` and the 2026-05-25 phase completion entry in `DEVLOG.md`.

## Phase 2: Extraction

Complete. Implemented `ExtractionResult`, `OpenAIStructuredExtractor`, `RuleBasedExtractor`, local JSON/schema enforcement, rule-based promise/coalition/inconsistency fallback, `config/prompts/state_updater.txt`, and 18-test coverage with fake toolkit client. 27 tests pass (including Phase 1 regression). See `DEVLOG_archive.md` and the 2026-05-25 phase completion entry in `DEVLOG.md`.
